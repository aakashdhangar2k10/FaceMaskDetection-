# Real-Time Face Mask Detection

A Python-based real-time face mask detection system using Machine Learning and AI. This project uses deep learning techniques to detect whether a person is wearing a mask in real-time video feeds.

## 🔍 Features

- Real-time face detection using webcam
- Classification of mask/no-mask using a trained deep learning model
- Lightweight and efficient using MobileNet architecture
- Visual feedback with bounding boxes and labels
